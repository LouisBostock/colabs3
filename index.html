                As technology has evolved to embrace modernity, society has increasingly adopted a more streamlined, simplistic approach to how we live, work, and interact. This evolution toward minimalism, reflected in everything from home decor and digital experiences to our daily routines, promises efficiency and ease, paring down to essentials.
                Minimalism, designed to make our lives easier, encourages us to declutter, to focus only on what adds value, and to minimize distractions. 
                <br><br>
                However, there is a trade-off: as we remove the "non-essentials," we may also unintentionally cast-off elements of tradition, culture, and personal meaning. The colours, textures, and nuances that once enriched our lives can fade into uniformity, leaving us with lives that may be easier, but perhaps emptier.
                <br><br>
                In this blog, we explore the impact of this minimalist transformation on our cultural and personal identities. Are we sacrificing depth, history, and individuality in favour of simplicity?

                <p>For all those who are with me here in 2024, wearable tech is all the craze. Whether it's the most recent Ray-Ban Meta glasses or Samsung's galaxy ring that include AI features for improved health tracking, we are taking real steps toward those futuristic movies that take just a few steps, and give us a glimpse of how humans can benefit from all this high tech. <br><br>
                
                Remember the one titled "her," being a 2013 film starring Joaquin Phoenix. A man falls in love with an artificially intelligent virtual assistant personified through a female voice. All from a tiny Bluetooth earbud. Fast forward to today's date of this writing, and the  wacky concept of this movie is within our grasp.</p>

            <h3>From Ornate to Minimalist</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The particular wearable technology I am going to discuss today is about  watches. Simplicity has greatly shaped the advancement of watches,  steering them away from just being timepieces to becoming much wider  representations of class and practicality. The first watches were quite detailed and elaborate, with intricate designs and many complications.
            <br><br>
            While being not very easy on the eye, these timepieces turned out to be beautiful. The change towards simplicity started in the 20th century, based on making timepieces more pragmatic and easier to read. This move developed in favor of simple straight lines, minimalist dials, and the removal of excess functionality — finally producing devices that were far more practical and  comprehensible.
            <br><br>
            One thing that has come to impact watch design is the rise of iconic models that place a premium on clarity and ease of reading. The likes of Rolex and Omega duly obliged with timepieces that are not just beautiful but  highly usable too. All this emphasis on simplicity brought forth  novelties such as clear and highly legible fonts, and a general scaling  back of dial clutter. Not only did this advance user experience, but it also set unprecedented industry standards that inspired many more in the trade of watchmaking  to make models by that principle.</p>

                <h3>From Paper to Pixels</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Can technology simply replace the original paper? Focusing on stationery such as Valentine’s cards – these are timeless crafts filled with traditions that use intricate art to convey romantic messages. The history of Victorian Valentine’s cards dates back to the early 19th century with the designs often adorned with delicate lace, embossing and ribbons so that the recipient can feel their sincerity. <br><br> Keeping with tradition, people are still sending cards to commemorate the national holiday of romance. However, moving towards contemporary times, simplicity has reached the likes of such stationery pieces.</p>

            <h3>Tradition: Vintage lace to elegant simplicity</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                From the 20th century onwards, card designs have taken a more minimalistic approach, focusing on the message written rather than the elaborate decoration. Elements such as imagery or simple illustrations became popular as well as clear typography to enhance the rather two-dimensional card - leaving the layers of material behind. Following ever-changing consumer tastes and mass production, the way people express their affection has adapted but in a digital world of ones and zeros, the sentimental value behind the tradition and craft has not been lost. <br><br>
                Companies such as Moonpig have gained major popularity through ease of delivery and a variety of formats such as through physical posts and e-cards. Therefore, technology has had an adverse effect on the stationery industry with card production companies having seen a decline in individuals purchasing physical cards in recent times. <br><br>
                That’s right, sending a loved one a card has never been easier through the advancements in digital technology. In the busy society today, e-cards have aided people through the ease of convenience. Whenever occasions arise, do you find yourself reaching for sentimental value or ease of convenience?

                <p>The journey of cars is an intriguing history of innovation and all sorts of societal change, dating all the way back to Karl Benz Motorwagen in 1866 to the Tesla Model S or the FF91 two incredibly advanced cars in today's society. Cars are continuously developing to keep up with trends and demands. <br><br>
                    As technology has advanced so did the focus on user experiences within the designs including cutting edge features helping enhance experiences within driving. However in competition for developing these highly advanced vehicles we can take a step back and see they have lost their sentimentality and charm. In this I will explore and discuss cars and examine the changes that go unnoticed in every day life.</p>

                <h3>Looking Back</h3><br>
                <p>If we take a step back in history looking at horse drawn carriages were primarily used for status as only upper class people in society had access. These were beautifully designed carriages all unique. They eventually advanced to wind powered carriages. <br><br>
                    The Model T was the first affordable and accessible car designed in 1908. Cars were still not common on roads until 1920 when these started becoming mass produced. This had a flip on society once they became accessible to all.
